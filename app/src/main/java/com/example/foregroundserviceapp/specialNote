Beginning with Android 14 (API level 34), when you
launch a foreground service, the system checks for specific prerequisites
 based on service type. For example, if you try to launch a foreground service of type location, the system checks to make sure your app already has either the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission. If it doesn't, the system throws SecurityException.
For this reason, you must confirm that the required prerequisites are met
before you start a foreground service. The foreground service type
documentation lists the required prerequisites for each foreground
service type.
